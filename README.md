Welcome to Thread Racing!

usage:
./threadracing (uses the default names)
or
./threadracing {name1} {name2} {name3} {name4} (you may input your own horse names)

dependancy:
threadracing uses pthread.h, which may or may not have come with your compiler.
The file named "threadracing" is already built using gcc and should hopefully
work on any Unix based system. I'm still relatively new to c programming, 
so if anything is in error please let me know.

enjoy!
