# Welcome to Thread Racing!


## History

Thorough Thread Racing started in class when my professor said race conditions are "usually" a bad thing. I was trying to come up with a useful application
of race conditions and the first thing I came up with was gambling. This program was originally written in C, with pthread, because that's what we were using
in class. Now I am re-doing it in C++ to touch up on my C++ multithreading skills, and make it more feature complete.


## Planned Features
1. Threads racing to complete the alphabet from a shared resource of random letters.
2. Players may name the threads.
3. Players may place bets on threads.
4. Thread progress printed during races.
